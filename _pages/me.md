{% include base_path %}
I am a researcher in computational mathematics, currently focusing on high-accuracy numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. My recent interests include Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, time-parallel solvers, and their applications in high-performance computing.

I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Liaoning Normal University, and I am deeply involved in both research and teaching. Beyond mathematics, I enjoy long-term strength training, endurance development, and studying the science of health and performance.
