This project investigated the theoretical and computational aspects of **superconvergence phenomena** in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, with the goal of improving both **time-stepping accuracy** and **scientific visualization** of numerical solutions.

### Key Objectives:

- Identify and characterize superconvergence points in DG methods.
- Develop **enhanced time integration schemes** that exploit superconvergence.
- Apply **SIAC filtering techniques** for improved post-processing and visualization.
- Evaluate the proposed methods on test problems including **wave propagation** and **shock interactions**.

### Project Duration:

**2013.02.01 – 2016.06.30**

### Funding:

European Office of Aerospace Research & Development,  
U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research  
**Grant ID:** FA8655-13-1-3017
