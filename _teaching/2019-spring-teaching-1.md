# Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations

## Course Information
* Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations (1107016008)
* This is an English taught course for students ready for both master and doctor degree. 
* The application used to demonstarte the live codes, interactive computing during lecture is call [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html).  The notebooks for this course are available to be viewed on [link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xiaozhouli/Jupyter/blob/master/Numerical_PDEs/).  


## Purpose of the Course:
This course presents the fundamentals of modern numerical techniques for a wide range of equations.  The emphasis is on building an understanding of the essential ideas that underlie the development, analysis, and practical use of finite difference methods.  The goals are:

* To understand the fundamental mathematics theory and algorithms of finite difference methods;
* To be able to implement finite difference methods for simple 1d and 2d problems as well as to evaluate and to interpret the numerical results; 
* To be able to solve some engineering problems by using known algorithms.
