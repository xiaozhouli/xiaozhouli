# Calculus I

***
## Course Information
* Calculus I (UoG11107.06)
* This is an English taught course for first-year undergraduate students.
* This course introduces the basic theory of functions of a single variable. Topics include function, limit and continuity; differential calculus of one variable functions; integral calculus of one variable functions and differential equations with constant coefficients.
* Teaching QQ group (slides, lecture notes): 949748117 


### Purpose of the Course:
This course aims to provide a mathematical foundation for functions of a single variable encountered throughout engineering, including both theory and extensive practice. 

#### Requirements by the end of this course:
* find the limits of functions; analyse the continuity of a function, classify discontinuous points and describe the general properties of a continuous function in closed interval;
* calculate first and higher-order derivatives, find the derivative of an implicit function, and apply derivatives to solve extreme value problems;
* explain the concept of a differential, and derive a linear approximation of a function;
* explain the concept of indeterminate form, and evaluate limits using l’Hôpital’s rule;
* describe the concepts of primitive function and indefinite integral, and apply basic integration formulas;
* describe the concept of definite integral, prove the fundamental theorem of Calculus, use the substitution rule and integration by parts; describe the geometrical and physical applications of definite integrals;
* describe the basic concepts of differential equations and solve separable differential equations, first-order and second-order linear differential equations, and selected nonhomogeneous linear differential equations; apply linear differential equations with constant coefficients to solve related problems in engineering.
